To use this script:

* We need the environment variables GH_PAT and GH_HOST with Personal Access Token and also the  host.
* Save the script to a file, e.g., github_pull_requests.sh.
* Make the script executable: chmod +x github_pull_requests.sh.
* Run the script: ./github_pull_requests.sh.


For the ECS problem I have used the approach of using the variables.tf and also main.tf files to make it easy to understand.
